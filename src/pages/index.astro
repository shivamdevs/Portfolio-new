        <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Shivam Dewangan. Nice to meet you.</h1>
        <p>
            Four years ago, my journey as a full-stack developer began after
            high school. I'm passionate about continual learning and
            improvement, always striving to solve design challenges with
            creativity and curiosity. I approach every project with confidence
            and enthusiasm, and love what I do in this dynamic and constantly
            evolving field.
