        <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Shivam Dewangan. Nice to meet you.</h1>
        <p>My journey as a full-stack developer started over 4 years ago, when i was still a High school graduate. Since then I became curious to learn more about this field. I learned many languages over time, and also took this route in the College by applying in full-stack programming. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.</p>
